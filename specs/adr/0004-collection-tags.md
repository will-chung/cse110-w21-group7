# Collection Tags

* Status: undecided
* Deciders: entire team
* Date: 2021-05-01
* Technical Story: TODO

## Context and Problem Statement

A bullet journal has collections, which groups logs and other entries together under one theme.
How should entries be organized into collections?

## Considered Options

* Collection Tags (tags that appear next to an entry's title)
* Breadcrumb Navigation (e.g., Larger Container > Smaller Container > Entry)

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Collection Tags", because

* Tags provide simple visual indication of which collection a certain entry belongs to
* Mimics physical "tabbing"
* Lends itself to a system for adding and removing entries to and from collections easily 
  
## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Collection Tags
* Good, because readily visible to users
* Good, because provides basis for further systems
* Good, because mimics physical "tabbing"
* Bad, because ...

### Breadcrumb Navigation
* Good, because allows for upward navigation from an entry
* Good, because visibly depicts collection-to-entry structure 
* Bad, because less visible (not as apparent)
